    Meet Dubi, a fun loving Tibetan Terrier. Dubi enjoys eating garbage, destroying household items, and terrorizing squirrels. Dubi is an extremely talented mess maker: last year alone he destroyed three rooms. His drive to rip apart pillows, tear blankets, and devour food off of the counter makes him a formidable opponent to those who wish to live in a clean environment.
